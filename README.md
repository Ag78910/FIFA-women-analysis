## 🧠 Project Overview

This notebook contains:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on player demographics, salaries, and team data.
- Visualizations: histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and radar plots.
- Two regression models to analyze the drivers of player salaries:
  - **Individual-based** (performance, age, reputation)
  - **Team-based** (prestige, average age)
- Policy recommendations to promote equity in women's football.

## 💡 Key Findings

- Strong positive correlation between a player's current performance and their salary.
- Team-level variables (prestige, team averages) have minimal impact on salary.
- Tactical attributes vary significantly by position, affecting player valuation.
- Wages are skewed and concentrated among a few nations and clubs.

## 🏆 Strategic Recommendations

- Financial aid for under-resourced clubs tied to development goals.
- Strengthening national leagues with policy and investment.
- Regional outreach in underrepresented areas to promote inclusion.
